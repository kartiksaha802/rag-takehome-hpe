    "# Minimal Local RAG: Llama 3.2 1B Implementation\n",
    "**Context:** Technical Interview Assignment | **Infrastructure:** Local CPU Optimized\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "This notebook implements a self-contained **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to run efficiently on standard local hardware. By utilizing **Quantized Small Language Models (SLMs)** and a file-based vector store, we achieve low-latency semantic search and generation without requiring GPU resources or external cloud dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Architecture: Local vs. Production\n",
    "To adhere to the assignment constraints while demonstrating readiness for enterprise scale, the system is designed with a clear separation between the current \"Minimal\" implementation and the standard \"Production\" architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inference Strategy:**\n",
    "    * *Current:* We use **Llama-3.2-1B (Int4 Quantized)** running on `llama.cpp` to optimize for local CPU memory (<1GB).\n",
    "    * *Production:* This would scale to larger enterprise models (e.g., Llama 3 70B) hosted on **vLLM** or **Triton Inference Server** with GPU acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vector Storage:**\n",
    "    * *Current:* **ChromaDB** is configured as a local persistent client for simplicity and zero-setup.\n",
    "    * *Production:* Data would migrate to a distributed vector database like **Milvus** or **Weaviate** to handle millions of vectors with high availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Orchestration & Ingestion:**\n",
    "    * *Current:* A linear Python pipeline handles document processing.\n",
    "    * *Production:* Automated workflows using **Kubeflow** or **Airflow** DAGs would manage continuous data ingestion and retraining pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
